ABSTRACT
The closed-door detection problem has been one of the favored research areas in different domains such as robotics and building information modeling. The main reason of that is door locations separate important parts of the environment such as rooms and corridors. Previous studies that focused on closed-door detection problem generally employed visual data. However, the success of those studies depends on the lighting conditions of the environments. In addition, the distance and angle of the door according to the camera position quite affect the performance of the studies. In this study, we utilized point cloud data to overcome these drawbacks of visual data as well as exploit the ability to describe the 3D characteristic of scenes of the point cloud data. We proposed a rule-based approach to identify closed doors and determine door positions. The rules were extracted regarding the relationship between walls and hinged doors. The experiments were conducted with the ESOGU DOORS dataset to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method. The test results showed that door detection rate was 95.93%.
